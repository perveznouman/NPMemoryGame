# NPMemoryGame
In this project we have shared sample code to create memory Game.
This Game actually carries 5 points on each mathcing case and reduces 1 points on each unmatch case.
We are also maintaining locally Database (Sqlite) to store every turn's score.
At the end of the game we are also displaying current positon, based on other score.
